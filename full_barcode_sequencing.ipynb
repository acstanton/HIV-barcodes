The input material was from 293Ts transfected with 0.1 MOI of lentivirus with a 15N barcode (plasmid 2626) with different single AA polymerase mutants. The cells were flow-sorted on BFP to isolate 10k infected cells from each sample. The 10k cells from each sample were split into 10 pools of 1000 cells after gDNA extraction, such that each sample has 10 indices associated with it."

We now want to take each unique barcode and, using the record id as an intermediate, find all of the read pairs that are associated with that barcode and group them together. Meanwhile, since we filtered out some reads in the previous step that had adaptor or length issues, we want to make sure that we only keep read pairs where both halves of the pair exist. \n",

    "### Probabilistic interlude #1\n",
    "We are about to use the Hamming distance metric to collapse barcode groups where the barcodes are very similar—specifically, when the distance between two barcodes is one. The motivation for this is that it seems relatively rare that two random 15mers would be so close as to differ by only one base, and PCR errors may be responsible for modifying barcodes that in fact originated from the same infection event.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how likely exactly is it that without errors, no pair of (presumably) random barcodes in a group of several thousand barcodes are exactly one base apart? Well, we can easily find this mathematically: given an equal probability of mutation from or to any base, the probability that two given random 15mers differ by exactly one base is \n",
    "\n",
    "$15\\times 0.25^{14}\\times 0.75 = 4.191\\times 10^{-8}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend this to 1000 barcodes (the theoretical number of barcodes in each index) and the probability of having all barcodes be at least 2 bases apart from all other barcodes is\n",
    "\n",
    "$(1 - (15\\times (0.25^{14}\\times 0.75))^{1000} = 0.999958$\n",
    "\n",
    "It therefore seems safe to assume any barcodes that are 1 base apart are a result of PCR errors and did not truly originate from different events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the above hamming_collapse function, I collapsed the barcodes into groups of a particular geometry. By this I mean that if a group is depicted as a graph where barcodes are nodes and edges exist where two nodes are at a Hamming distance of one, the graph has the following properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each node shares an edge with at least one other node\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Every pair of nodes has a path between them (the graph is connected)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each pair of nodes does not necessarily have an edge between them (the graph is not necessarily complete)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if a group contains barcodes A, B, and C, A and B may be different by one base and B and C may be different by one base, but A and C can be different by either one or two bases. This can theoretically result in an arbitrarily long chain of barcodes. I chose to ignore this (instead removing large groups at the end) as I couldnt come up with a better solution. \n"

    "### Managing internal disagreement within barcode groups\n",
    "So far we have created groups of reads that either came from the same barcode or came from barcodes that were only one base apart. We assume that each of these groups of reads corresponds to a single unique virus infecting a single cell, which should mean that all of the sequences within a barcode group are identical save for errors introduced in PCR. Note that this assumption only holds if there were the correct number of viruses added to the cells such that \n",

    "1. Each cell is only infected by one virus, and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. No two viruses have the same barcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 is mostly taken care of by the low MOI used to infect (MOI of ~0.1 ensures <1% multiple infection). 2 is trickier and it relies on the assumption that the library of viruses is sufficiently diverse to favor unique barcodes. My calculations indicated that around 57,000 unique transformants went into the maxiprep that produced the plasmid containing the barcode. Assuming that this complexity was preserved through maxiprep and transfection, at an MOI of 0.1 each well containing 2,000,000 cells was infected with 100,000 viruses. The number of times each barcode is drawn with 100,000 trials can be modeled with a multinomial distribution where the probability of each barcode being drawn is 1/57000. Let's model this in the code block below."

    "However, we aren't taking all of the cells in the original sample, only 10,000 of them. This introduces some narrowing of barcodes and already starts to limit the number of barcode collisions. We can model this with a multivariate hypergeometric distribution, which is the generalization of the hypergeometric distribution. It goes like this: say that there are $K_{i}$ balls of color $i$ in the urn, and you draw $n$ balls without replacement. Then the number of balls of each color in the sample $(k_{1}, k_{2}, ..., k_{c})$ has the multivariate hypergeometric distribution. In python we define this distribution in terms of the hypergeometric distribution."
