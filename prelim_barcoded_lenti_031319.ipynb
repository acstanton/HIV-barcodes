We now want to take each unique barcode and, using the record id as an intermediate, find all of the read pairs that are associated with that barcode and group them together. Meanwhile, since we filtered out some reads in the previous step that had adaptor or length issues, we want to make sure that we only keep read pairs where both halves of the pair exist. \n",

    "Given that collapsing barcodes in this case removed a few hundred closely related barcodes, we might be curious as to additional properties of the Hamming distances found in this dataset. Specifically, we might want to know that other than occasional single base PCR errors, the barcodes are far enough apart that they appear random. Let's explore this by taking a subset of the barcodes from A272S after collapsing and comparing the pairwise Hamming distances in this set to a group of random barcodes. The following block of code does this comparison and outputs the results as a graph."

    "### Managing internal disagreement within barcode groups\n",
    "So far we have created groups of reads that either came from the same barcode or came from barcodes that were only one base apart. We assume that each of these groups of reads corresponds to a single unique virus infecting a single cell, which should mean that all of the sequences within a barcode group are identical save for errors introduced in PCR. Note that this assumption only holds if there were the correct number of viruses added to the cells such that \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each cell is only infected by one virus, and\n",
    "\n",
    "2. No two viruses have the same barcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 is mostly taken care of by the low MOI used to infect (actual MOI of ~0.03 ensures <1% multiple infection). 2 is trickier and it relies on the assumption that the library of viruses is sufficiently diverse to favor unique barcodes. My calculations indicated that around 57,000 unique transformants went into the maxiprep that produced the plasmid containing the barcode. Assuming that this complexity was preserved through maxiprep and transfection, at an MOI of 0.03 each well containing 1,500,000 cells was infected with 45,000 viruses. The number of times each barcode is drawn with 45,000 trials can be modeled with a multinomial distribution where the probability of each barcode being drawn is 1/57000. Let's model this in the code block below."

    "Evidently, this is probably going to be a problem. We don't want any non-unique barcodes, as this prohibits us from tracing each error to one integration event. The only obvious solution is to discard all groups where there is any disagreement between the sequences within the group. This will certainly take care of PCR errors, and it will also take care of any incidents where two viruses with the same barcode infect different cells and cause different errors or where one causes an error and one does not. The two cases that aren't covered here is if two viruses with the same barcode infect different cells and neither one causes an error or they both cause exactly the same error. The former seems far more likely than the latter. This is impossible to detect and correct for, and as a result the error rate calculations are likely to be skewed in favor of higher error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two different ways to correct this seem apparent. The first is obviously to re-make the library with at least tenfold higher complexity. The second, which is more of a band-aid solution, is to sequence longer reads, which would increase the probability of finding an in-group mismatch if a group contains reads from multiple infection events.\n",
